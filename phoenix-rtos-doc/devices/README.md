# Device drivers

Phoenix-RTOS implements device drivers as device servers running on the user level. The communication with drivers is done via message passing using well-defined interface for exchanging the data between programs and drivers.

To control the device, two mechanisms are necessary and should be provided by the operating system kernel: access to device hardware registers and method of handling interrupts triggered by it. The architecture of these Phoenix-RTOS mechanisms has been presented in the chapterâ€™s subsections.

## Generic driver architecture

Each typical driver in Phoenix-RTOS consist of the main function which typically parses command line parameters, creates a driver communication port, registers it in the operating system, namespace, initializes device and starts processing of the incoming messages.

Message are fetched from the queue using `msgRecv` syscall. This syscall blocks thread until a message is available, so the device server should implement thread pool to process the incoming request. Client is blocked until server responds to the message using `msgRespond` syscall. There are two approaches for message processing - concurrent processing and iterative processing.

## Concurrent processing 
Messages which can be processed instantly may be serviced by one of main loop threads. 

## Iterative processing
If delays are expected (e.g. waiting for I/O) message should be inserted to the server's internal queue and processed by the internal thread.

## Source code

The source code of the Phoenix-RTOS device drivers could be obtained using the following command

>
    git clone http://git.phoenix-rtos.com/phoenix-rtos-devices

The documentation of particular driver is provided within its source code repository.
